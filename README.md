# Legato - Frontend
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Legato project's frontend!

## The project
### The idea
The Legato project aims to create a community space where registered users can find each other based on their music
preferences. With Legato, we can meet people with whom we have a good chance of finding a common voice. As our motto
holds: Music connects people

### The frontend
This repository contains the source files of Legato's main user interface which displays the data served by Legato's
backend. It is a one-pager responsive website which aims to provide the highest possible level of user experience made
available by current state-of-the-art developer technologies.

### The technologies
The frontend of the Legato social network were created with the following technologies:
 * Main web technologies:
    * **HTML**
    * **CSS**
    * **JavaScript**
 * **React** as the main frontend UI framework
 * **Redux** as the state container of the application
 * **Babel** which enables the user interface to use the latest technologies of JavaScript
 * **Material UI** as the main source of ready-to-use React components
